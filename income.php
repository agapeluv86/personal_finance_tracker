      <h2 >How Your Money Flows Each Month</h2>
           <br></br>
      <p>Once in a while, one needs to take a broader look of things, even personal <br>finances.
        To help you see your monthly flow of finances from a higher gro<br>-und, we made the “river flow” graph.</p>
    
      <div class="col-md-12 p-3"><img src="images/income.webp" alt="it5" class="img-fluid"></div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>Imagine the money that you earn and spend each month as a system of rivers.<br> It flows in, hopefully rests a bit 
        in a lake of your making, then most of it flows <br> out again to replenish the fields – or yourself and your phone bill.
         With some<br> good planning you can build yourself a dam and some accumulation lakes on<br> the side, just to 
         be safe if a dry season ever hits you.<br></p>
         
         <div class="col-md-12 p-3"><img src="images/income1.webp" alt="it5" class="img-fluid"></div>
         </div>
        </div>   
         
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The number at the very top is your income, your main inbound stream. If you<br> set up your monthly budget for all 
            expenses, that will be the dam that you<br> constructed. Income flows in and hits the dam. If the income amount is
             larger <br>than the budget amount, the difference will flow into your savings for the dry <br>months.
             It’s good to grow an “accumulation lake” or your “savings account” as <br>your less poetic banker would call it.<br></br>
             If the budget is larger than the income, you’re living beyond your means and<br> need to readjust the budget. Or even better,
              increase the income if possible.<br></br>
              Beyond your budget dam and monthly money lake, your expenses flow out.<br>
               <b>The width of the flow represents its size.</b><br></br>
               The flow in  <b>dark red</b> are <span style="color:red">expenses</span> that have already been made.<br></br>
               The <b>pink flow</b> are your <span style="background-color: pink;">planned expenses</span>, the ones which are coming this month,<br> but have not been 
               due yet.<br></br>
               The <b>green flow</b> is your <span style="color: green;">“left to spend”</span> money. The money that you have already<br> budgeted for, so it should
                hold by the end of the month, but you have yet to let<br> it flow out of the dam.
                <br></br>
               If you have not built your dam yet (set up a monthly budget for all expenses), <br>
               then the flows will simply be going straight down, but their width still <br> representing their size.</p>

           <p>If your expense flow is much stronger than the income one, you know the lakes<br> will run dry rather quickly.
             It’s a situation 
            that should be quickly fixed. Hopefully<br> you’ve accumulated enough in the past to weather through this dry season.</p>

            <p>Hopefully, the river flow graph will help you get a good understanding of your<br> money flows and you’ll be able 
              to avoid the dire situations before they occur.</p>
