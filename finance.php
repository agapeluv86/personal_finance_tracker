 <p>Getting a complete sense of your personal finances is important, even<br> when you just open the app for a quick peek. 
    That’s why we made the<br> Monthly Overview graph.
   We included the information you need right<br> away and made it easy to go deeper when you need more details.
   <br></br>It’s true that this graph contains a few more elements than usual, so there<br> is a bit of a learning curve.
    But give it a chance, it will make the quick<br> looks at your finances a lot more effective.</p>

<div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-6 p-4"><p><b style="color:green">“Left to spend”</b>
  As the name implies, this big green number tells you<br> how much money is remaining for you to spend this month.
   If you<br> have set up a monthly budget,all the expenses in this month will be<br> deducted from the budget amount and
    what you get is Left to spend.<br></br>
    <b style="color:green">“Progress bar”</b> The green-coloured background of the graph is a progress <br>
     bar that tells you how much money you have “left to spend”. The length of <br> the graph represents all the money 
     you have “left to spend” in the month.<br> In the beginning of the month, the whole graph is green. But as you add 
     more <br> expenses, it starts shrinking from left towards the right side. Kind of like a glacier,<br>
   but a green one. The green lollipop shows you where it ends and tells you how <br>much you have left to spend.

 <div class="col-md-6 p-2"><h5><b style="color:green">Overspent</b></h5><br></br>
<p>If you surpass the budget amount you have set for yourself, or spend more than you earn, the progress bar will start appearing from the left in red colour, with
   the red lollipop up front. In that case it will display how much you went over your budget, or overspent your earnings.<br></br>
   You can also see an upside-down lollipop in dark grey with <b style="color:darkgray">“today”</b> written on it. This lollipop shows current day compared
    to the time of the entire month. The entire length of the graph represents all the time in the month and the “today” lollipop displays where you are now.</p>

 <div class="row">
 
 <div class="col-md-6 p-4"><h4>Expenses – spending per month</h4><br></br>
<p>
  Shows the sum of expenses each month, but can also be filtered to display spending on certain categories,
   tags, locations and financial accounts.<br></br>

   You can zero-in on specific data you’re interested in and want to see over a longer period of time.
 Let’s say you want to know how your spending on Food & Drinks varies in time. Click on “Expense categories” 
 in the right sidebar, “Select categories” and click “Food & Drinks”. The graph will immediately filter to 
 show you only spending data for the Food & Drinks category, so you can see how it varies through the year.
 You can narrow it down even further by selecting a tag. Do the same in the “expense tags” section and 
 you can see how much you spent only on restaurants, alcohol, groceries or a combination of multiple tags.

<p> Shows the sum of incomes each month, but can also be filtered to display earnings on certain categories,
   tags and financial accounts.</p><br></br>
   <h4>Net worth – total balance of your financial accounts</h4>
   <p> These funds accumulate if you have regular surpluses on your monthly balances. 
    The amounts reflect the account balances at the end of the month.</p>

<p> <b>Planned entries</b>

  These are the expenses, incomes and transfers you have already entered into the future, or were generated automatically based on the repeating entry settings that you have set earlier. We advise to add much of these as you can possibly predict. They’ll help you plan your future months so you can keep financial stress down to the minimum.
  
  These planned entries can be set to display in the graph or not. You can set
   this by clicking the month on the top of the page, then setting the switch for Planned ON or OFF. <br>
  
  <b>Estimates</b>
  
  Estimates project your past trends in earning and spending into the future, providing a rough guide of what to expect with your balances, spending, earnings or net worth if the current trends continue as they have so far.
  
  As it’s based on your past data, the more time you’ve been tracking your finances, the more precise they can become.
   We’ll also be improving the algorithm for this over time, so it will become better at guessing your spending patterns.
  
  You can switch estimates ON or OFF.</p><br></br>
