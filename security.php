 <div class="col-md-6 p-5"><h2><b>Our Infrastructure Security</b></h2><br>
<p>
  Strong data security practices go beyond technological methods and practices. Most major data
   breaches occur because of flaws in security processes and so called “social engineering” attacks.
  Agape protects from these sorts of attacks using strict security standards and
   limiting the possible access points to customer data. Our databases are maintained using
    Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, known for their world class physical and digital security. No employee,
     not even our top security developers, has direct access to customer data. All access to our systems 
     requires multi-factor authentication, and there are no “super admin” user accounts that have privileged 
     access to customer data.
    Agape is subject to strict regular security audits and penetration tests in order to identify
     all possible risk factors to our digital network, our physical systems.</p>
